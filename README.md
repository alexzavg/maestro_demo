### IMPORTANT
It is suggested to perform env cleanup before each run to avoid any potential issues with ports, processes and emulators.

```bash
npm run maestro:inspect

npm run report:open
```
- Open AI report
```bash
npm run report:ai:open
```

1. Get the app apk (download the latest build from the dev branch / ask your dev team on how to get it)
2. Start an Android emulator
```bash
npm run maestro:device:start:android
```
3. Install the app
```bash
npm run android:install:wikipedia (replace 'wikipedia' with your app apk)
```
4. Run tests
```bash
npm run maestro:test:wikipedia (adjust paths for .maestro/flows and .maestro/configs with your own settings)
```
5. Uninstall the app
```bash
npm run android:uninstall:wikipedia (replace 'wikipedia' with your app apk)

## IMPORTANT
It is strongly suggested to kill the ports, processes and emulators manually (e.g. if your emulator/app is frozen or if you're done with the day and logging off):
```bash
npm run kill:ports
npm run kill:processes
npm run kill:emulators
```
